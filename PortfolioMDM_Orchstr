## Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Algorithm that is based on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and can be deployed: 
-- to find the optimal combination of assets in a portfolio to maximize returns while minimizing risk. 
-- takes into account the expected returns, volatility, and correlations of the assets in the portfolio.
-- Use a table called `portfolio` with columns `asset`, `returns`, and `volatility`

-- Calculate the covariance matrix
SELECT COVAR_POP(returns1, returns2) AS covariance
FROM portfolio p1
JOIN portfolio p2 ON p1.asset <> p2.asset

-- Calculate the expected return of each asset
SELECT AVG(returns) AS expected_return
FROM portfolio

-- Use the covariance matrix and expected returns to optimize the portfolio
-- (this can be done using a programming language like Python or R, which can be integrated with Azure/Snowflake)

## Run Monte Carlo Simulation to to model the probability of different outcomes in a portfolio. 
-- It generates multiple simulations of potential future scenarios and analyzes the results to identify the likelihood of different investment outcomes.
-- Value at Risk (VaR): This algorithm is used to estimate the potential losses that could occur in a portfolio over a given time period. 
-- It calculates the maximum loss that could occur at a specific confidence level.

-- Assume we have a table called `portfolio` with columns `asset`, `returns`, and `volatility`

-- Generate 1000 simulations of portfolio returns over the next year
WITH simulation AS (
  SELECT asset, 
         AVG(returns) + volatility * RANDOM() * SQRT(1/365) AS simulated_return
  FROM portfolio
  GROUP BY asset
  CROSS JOIN TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT=>1000)) -- generate 1000 rows for each asset
)

-- Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the simulated returns for the portfolio
SELECT AVG(simulated_return) AS mean_return, 
       STDDEV(simulated_return) AS risk
FROM simulation

## Value at Risk (VaR): apply it to estimate the potential losses that could occur in a portfolio over a given time period. 
-- It calculates the maximum loss that could occur at a specific confidence level.
-- Assume we have a table called `portfolio` with columns `asset`, `returns`, and `volatility`

-- Calculate the 5% VaR for the portfolio over the next year
SELECT -1 * SQRT(1/365) * NTH_VALUE(simulated_return, 500) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY simulated_return ASC) AS VaR
FROM (
  -- Generate 10,000 simulations of portfolio returns over the next year
  WITH simulation AS (
    SELECT asset, 
           AVG(returns) + volatility * RANDOM() * SQRT(1/365) AS simulated_return
    FROM portfolio
    GROUP BY asset
    CROSS JOIN TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT=>10000)) -- generate 10,000 rows for each asset
  )

  -- Calculate the simulated portfolio returns
  SELECT SUM(simulated_return) AS portfolio_return
  FROM simulation
  GROUP BY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT 1))
)

## Black-Litterman Model: apply to adjust the expected returns and risks of assets in a portfolio based on the investor's views and market expectations. 
-- It combines the investor's views with the market equilibrium to generate a new set of expected returns and risks.
-- Assume we have a table called `views` with columns `asset`, `view`, and `view_weight`
-- and a table called `market` with columns `asset`, `market_return`, and `market_weight`

-- Calculate the implied equilibrium returns
SELECT market.asset, 
       market_weight * market_return + SUM(view_weight * view) AS implied_return
FROM market
JOIN views ON market.asset = views.asset
GROUP BY market.asset, market_weight, market_return

-- Calculate the covariance matrix
SELECT COVAR_POP(returns1, returns2) AS covariance
FROM portfolio p1
JOIN portfolio p2 ON p1.asset <> p2.asset

-- Calculate the posterior expected returns
SELECT implied_return + covariance * (covariance + lambda * COVAR_POP(implied_return, returns)) * (returns - implied_return) AS posterior_return
FROM (
  -- Calculate the current expected returns
  SELECT AVG(returns) AS returns, asset
  FROM portfolio
  GROUP BY asset
) current_returns
JOIN (
  -- Calculate the market weights
  SELECT SUM(weight)


## Bayesian Network: apply to model the relationships between different assets in a portfolio. 
-- It analyzes the dependencies between the assets and updates the probabilities of different outcomes as new data becomes available.
-- Assume we have a table called `portfolio` with columns `asset`, `returns`, `market_returns`, and `news_sentiment`

-- Create a Bayesian network to model the dependencies between the variables
CREATE NETWORK `portfolio_network` (
  `asset` TEXT, 
  `returns` NUMERIC, 
  `market_returns` NUMERIC, 
  `news_sentiment` NUMERIC
) AS (
  -- Define the relationships between the variables
  `asset` -> `returns`,
  `market_returns` -> `returns`,
  `news_sentiment` -> `returns`
);

-- Train the Bayesian network using the portfolio data
TRAIN `portfolio_network` USING (
  SELECT asset, 
         returns, 
         market_returns, 
         news_sentiment
  FROM portfolio
)

-- Use the trained Bayesian network to make predictions or generate simulations
-- (this can be done using a programming language like Python or R, which can be integrated with Snowflake)


## Ensemble of Identical independent Evaluatorsâ€™ topology based on: 
-- Online Stochastic Batch learning scheme, 
-- Portfolio Vector Memory, 
-- Explicit reward function deployment,
-- Eestimates such inputs as: trading period, transaction cost, price tensor, filing missing data, other parameters can be added. 
-- Example of a three dimensional Price Tensor: 
-- Time: This represents the period of time over which the prices are tracked. It can be divided into discrete intervals, such as days or months.
-- Assets: This represents the set of assets in the portfolio. Each asset has its own price history, which is represented as a time series.
-- Metrics: This represents the different metrics that are tracked for each asset, such as the opening price, closing price, high price, low price, and volume.
